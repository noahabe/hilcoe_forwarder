# hilcoe_forwarder
A telegram bot that forwards messages to a HiLCoE group. 

In HiLCoE each course has its own specific telegram group. This is 
good, for separation of subjects but it makes the life of students a bit harder. 

For example if a student is taking 6 courses, there he has to check 
6 different groups in order to be on track. 

This bot tries to solve that problem, by forwarding all messages from those 6 groups
to a single group. That way the student can only follow a single group and mute the others
if he/she sees fit.
